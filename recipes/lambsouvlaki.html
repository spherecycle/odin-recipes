        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This lamb souvlaki recipe features marinated pieces of lamb, threaded on 
        skewers, and char-grilled to perfection. I like to serve these with rosemary
        garlic roasted potatoes, a Greek salad, and pita bread. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li> 
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li> 
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li> 
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li> 
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li> 
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li> 
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless leg of lamb, trimmed of all fat and cut into 1-inch cubes </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, garlic, salt, 
                and pepper together in a medium bowl. Add cubed lamb and stir until lamb 
                is coated with marinade. Cover and refrigerate 3 hours, or overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Lay shrimp flat in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with any bread crumb 
            mixture remaining in the bag. Drizzle melted butter over the top.</li>
            <li>Thread marinated lamb onto skewers, reserving any remaining marinade. 
                Grill skewers until desired doneness, 10 to 12 minutes, basting with 
                the reserved marinade and turning occasionally for even cooking.</li>
        </ol>
